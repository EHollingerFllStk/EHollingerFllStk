### Hi there 👋

I am a FullStack Software Engineering student at General Assembly embarking on an exciting journey to learning the nuances of software engineering. 

Transitioning from the health sector, I worked as a Doctor of Physical Therapy using my clinical thinking skills.  I enjoyed providing outstanding patient care in multiple environments by using both my creative and logical skills to formulate individualized plans of care.

I look forward to using both my strong skills in communication with my ability to problem solve to delve into my new learning adventure.



When I’m not coding, you’ll find my playing music as I play a lot of different instruments (poorly). 

I am currently working on a project incorporating HTML< CSS, JavaScript, jQuery linking it to an API to emulate the bird songs I hear in my small patch of the world, more specifically, my backyard!
