### Hi there 👋

- 💻 I am a FullStack Software Engineering student at General Assembly embarking on an exciting journey to learn the nuances of software engineering. 

- 🩺 Transitioning from the health sector, I worked as a Doctor of Physical Therapy using my clinical thinking skills.  I enjoyed providing outstanding patient care in multiple environments by using both my creative and logical skills to formulate individualized plans of care.

- ⛰️  I look forward to using both my strong skills in communication with my ability to problem solve to delve into my new learning adventure.

- 🥁 When I’m not coding, you’ll find my playing music as I play a lot of different instruments (some better than others! 😆). 

- 🌱 I am currently working on a project incorporating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery linking it to an API to emulate the bird songs I hear in my small patch of the world, more specifically, my backyard!
