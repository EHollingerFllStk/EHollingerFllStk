# Hi there üëã #

- üíª I am a FullStack Software Engineer, and recent graduate General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, embarking on an exciting journey learning the nuances working with multiple coding languages, frameworks and databases. 

- ü©∫ Transitioning from the health sector, I worked as a Doctor of Physical Therapy using my clinical thinking skills.  I enjoyed providing outstanding patient care in multiple environments by using both my creative and logical skills to formulate individualized plans of care. Similarly, I use these same skills to analyze and debug code.

- ‚õ∞Ô∏è  I look forward to using both my strong skills in communication with my ability to problem solve to delve into my new learning adventure and bring success to my next employer.

- ü•Å When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me plucking away on my guitar or ukulele or banging on my drums. 

- üå± I am currently working on an Udemy course called The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp with Angela Yu to review all that I have learned along the way!
